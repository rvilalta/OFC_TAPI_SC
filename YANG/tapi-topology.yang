                A TopologicalEntity may suffer degradation or failure as a result of a problem in a part of the underlying realization.
                The realization can be partitioned into segments which have some relevant common failure modes.
                There is a risk of failure/degradation of each segment of the underlying realization.
                Each segment is a part of a larger physical/geographical unit that behaves as one with respect to failure (i.e. a failure will have a high probability of impacting the whole unit (e.g. all cables in the same duct).
                Disruptions to that larger physical/geographical unit will impact (cause failure/errors to) all TopologicalEntities that use any part of that larger physical/geographical entity.
                Any TopologicalEntity that uses any part of that larger physical/geographical unit will suffer impact and hence each TopologicalEntity shares risk.
